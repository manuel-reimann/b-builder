‚ú® Overview

Bouquet Builder is a web application that allows employees and B2B customers of agrotropic AG to digitally design flower bouquets. Using drag-and-drop elements, users create a floral composition in a 2D editor, which can then be rendered into a photorealistic image via integration with a generative AI.

**Why?**

The current quotation process (physical arrangement, photography, retouching) is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to reproduce. This project aims to significantly optimize the process using digital tools.
